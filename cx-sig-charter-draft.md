# Contributor Experience Special Interest Group Charter

This charter uses the Roles and Organization Management outlined in [sig-governance](https://github.com/spinnaker/governance/blob/master/governance.md).

## Scope

The Contributor Experience Special Interest Group (SIG) is responsible for improving the experience of those who contribute upstream to the Spinnaker project. We do this by creating, and maintaining programs and processes that promote community health and reduce project friction while retiring those programs and processes that don't. Being conscientious of our contributor base is critical to scaling the project, growing the ecosystem, and helping the project succeed.

We do this by listening - whether itâ€™s through our roadshows to SIG meetings, surveys, data, or [GitHub issues](https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker/issues), we take in the feedback and turn it into our project list. We build a welcoming and inclusive community of contributors by giving them places to be heard and productive.

### In scope

#### Projects & Services

-  In accordance with the code of conduct, establish policies, standards, and procedures for the use, moderation, and management of all public platforms officially used by the project, including but not limited to:
  - [GitHub Management](https://github.com/spinnaker)
  - [Slack](https://join.spinnaker.io/)
  - [Spinnaker](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcxQbw8kT1-FRhFhO2QCetg) YouTube channel
  - Zoom
  - Google Meet
- Set up alerting automation for GitHub events, including new contributors, new issues, and new pull requests.
- Work with other SIGs and interested parties in the project to execute GitHub tasks where required, see [GitHub Management](https://github.com/spinnaker) for more detail
- Own and execute events that are targeted to the Spinnaker contributor community, including:
  - Contributor Summit(s) 
  - [Gardening Days and hackathons](https://github.com/spinnaker-hackathon/gardening)
  - Retrospective moderation for other SIGs upon request
  - Other events, like other SIG face to face events, upon request and consideration
- Strategize, build, and execute on scalable mentoring programs for all contributor levels. These may include:
  - [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/)
  - [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/)
- New mentoring programs: office hours, meet the contributors, 1:1 pairing, group mentoring, etc.
- Help onboard new and current contributors into the culture, workflow, and CI of our contributor experience through the [contributor guide](https://spinnaker.io/community/contributing/), other related documentation, contributor summits, and programs tailored to onboarding.
- Perform issue triage on and maintain the spinnaker/contributor-experience repository.  
- Help SIGs with being as transparent and open as possible through creating best practices, guidelines, and general administration of YouTube, Zoom, and our mailing lists where applicable
- Document and assist SIGs/WG Chairs and Technical Leads with organizational management operations
- Distribute contributor related news on various Spinnaker channels, including Continous Delivery Foundation ([CDF](https://cd.foundation)) for posting blogs, social media, and other platforms as needed.
- Establish and share metrics to measure project health, community health, and general trends, including:
  - [DevStats](https://spinnaker.devstats.cd.foundation/)
  - the CDF contribution gamification app [[WIP](https://github.com/ExitoLab/spinnaker_gamification_app)]
  - contributor experience survey(s)
  - engagement on project platforms
  - pull request and issue engagement and closure times
- Set community health goals such as improved PR and issue engagement and closure times, and track progress towards their achievement using established metrics.
- Research other OSS projects and consult with their leaders about contributor experience topics to make sure we are always delivering value to our contributors
- Create and maintain subprojects that incentivize community outreach, individual content creation, and welcoming/onboarding of new contributors

#### Cross-project and Externally Facing Processes

We cross-cut all SIGs and working groups to deliver the following processes:

- Deploying Changes:
 This SIG will create change-deployment policies that balance quick response to the needs of the community and a limit on disruptions for project contributors. We will create policies to socialize and elicit feedback on changes via community channels such as Slack, spinnaker.io, Twitter, mailing lists, SIG meetings, delegating to SIG leads, etc. The amount of notice we provide and the amount of consensus we seek is driven by our estimation of risk. We can estimate risk based on these parameters:

- Low-risk changes impact a small number (<3) of SIGs, working groups, or repositories, do not break existing contributor workflows, and are easy to roll back.
- High-risk changes impact a large number (>3) of SIGs, working groups, or repositories, break existing contributor workflows and are not easy to roll back.
- Depending on how wide of an ecosystem change this is, we may also slack, blog, tweet, and use other channels to get the word out.
- Our standard time box is 72 business hours; however, there may be situations where we need to act quickly but the time period will always be clear and upfront.
- Encourage automation to improve productivity for contributors where it makes sense, and consult with SIG leads on automation workflows.

If we need funding for any reason, we approach [CDF](https://cd.foundation).
CDF may contribute funding to our platforms, processes, and/or programs. They do not play a day-to-day operations role and have bestowed that to our community to run as we see fit. Since they do fund some of our initiatives, this means that they hold owner account privileges on certain platforms like Zoom and Slack. The CX SIG will work to ensure that project maintainers are included as admins.

### Out of scope

- Code for the testing and CI infrastructure
- User community management.
- The contributor experience for repositories not included in the Spinnaker organization
- We do not create SIGs/working group but can assist in the various community management needs of their micro-communities that would kick off their formation and keep them going.
- We are not a code of conduct committee and therefore do not control incident management reporting or decisions; however, our mission includes acting swiftly if there is a clear violation of either our code of conduct or one of the terms of our supported platform of service.

## Roles and Organization Management

This sig adheres to the Roles and Organization Management outlined in Spinnaker's governance policy and will actively suggest updates to those policies as part of our work.


### Additional responsibilities of Chairs

Chairs SHOULD plan Contributor Experience meetings monthly at the least, and should strive to enable annual face to face interaction as conditions allow. Chairs will also ensure that technical changes from subprojects follow the process change communication guidelines we establish.

### Deviations from sig-governance
Six months after this charter is first ratified, it MUST be reviewed and re-approved by the SIG in order to evaluate the assumptions made in its initial drafting.
